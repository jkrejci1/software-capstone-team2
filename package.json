  "description": "Capstone project made for Lewis University, created for Fairmont Community Partnership Group, Inc.\r The purpose of this project is to create a website that can serve as a design that can later be added to,\r in order to create an environment to organize and schedule events and keep track of volunteers.\r The volunteer can create an account, or anyone else can create an account for the website as well, but\r they would have different permissions in what they could do on the website though. There is also an \r administrator account using a secure email and password for the company, which would have the \r highest privileges of any account and could be later used to add or remove volunteers and schedules, etc.",
